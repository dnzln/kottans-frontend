### Kottans Front-End Course


## 1. Git and GitHub

    The interactive course on Udacity was great! It was not easy
    to understand how git works and how I can use it, but now
    I know more about it. Almost all the information was new to me.
    I was surprised at how Git can store so much information and versions
    different files and provide so fast switching between them.
    I hope that I will use all these new tools in the future and become a Git professional!

    Extra material like (Git за 30 хвилин)[https://codeguida.com/post/453] and 
    (Learn git branching)[http://learngitbranching.js.org/] also was very helpful
    to put in order all new information and to deepen understanding of branching.
