# Kottans Front-End Course

## Git and GitHub

The interactive course on Udacity was great! It was not easy
to understand how git works and how I can use it, but now
I know more about it. Almost all the information was new to me.
I was surprised at how Git can store so much information and versions
different files and provide so fast switching between them.
I hope that I will use all these new tools in the future!

Extra material like [Git за 30 хвилин](https://codeguida.com/post/453) and 
[Learn git branching](http://learngitbranching.js.org/) also was very helpful
to put in order all new information and to deepen understanding of branching.

## Linux CLI, and HTTP

I already knew something about the Linux Command Line,
but the Codecademy course has revealed many new ways how
I can interact with the computer using CL. Input and output redirection,
sorting and searching files, setting up the environment
with bash_profile - it was all completely new to me. I'm going to
use some of this new knowledge to work faster with files in repositories
and do more in CL without using explorer.

Information in articles about HTTP protocol was hard to understand
at the beginning, but from the second (or third) attempt 
I understood what HTTP is and how it works. 
For me it was new to learn about the structure of HTTP messages and 
how caching and authorization work. This information can help me 
create better websites and web applications.

## Git Collaboration

These courses helped consolidate Git's knowledge of the first task.
Commands like "git rebase", "git revert", "git reset" and "git commit --amend"
were new to me. I met them in additional materials from the first task, 
but did not fully understand how to use them. 
Now I understand and am going to use them to edit the history of commits.

## Intro to HTML and CSS

I really liked html academy - all information was easy 
to understand and theory was given in a friendly way. Freecodecamp also provides
good HTML and CSS basics. I have already taken some of these courses before,
but it was great to update old knowledge. Some tools were new to me, for example
awsome [box-shadow generator](https://www.cssmatic.com/box-shadow), 
whitch I maybe will use in the future. Also I found great new 
reference [CSS Almanac](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/) in Udacity course.

## Responsive Web Design

This was an interesting section. I learned about the different ways for creating layouts, 
how to make them adaptive, and also done a fun training session with frogs for understanding the work of flexbox. Almost everything was new to me, and I hope to use this knowledge to create responsive websites.

## JS Basics

At university I taught C a little, so the basic constructions were already familiar to me. 
In this course, I learned about the features of the Javascript language and its syntax. 
It was very interesting to solve algorithmic problems on freecodecamp also. 
I going to use these knowledge to write quality code in the future :)

## DOM

This part was little hard to understand, since I had never worked with DOM before. 
Everything related to the interaction with the page through JS was new to me. 
I was happy to try my hand at performing a test task, because at the beginning I didn't feel confident at all. 
I was glad to consolidate my knowledge on practice. I will use understanding of how DOM works pretty often, 
because it is absolutely necessary for the everyday work of web-developer.

## A Tiny JS World

It was a simple task, so it’s hard to say what was surprising and what was new to me. 
I was glad to practice coding, and I knew about an interesting use case for array.join 
and some other nuances about outputting data from an object.

## Object Oriented JS

It was a very interesting task, although at the beginning it was difficult to figure out 
what to do with the game Frogger. The course on the OOP was not difficult except for some moments,
for me almost everything was new. I was surprised that in JS you can create a classes in different styles.

## OOP Exercise

At first it seemed that it would be easy to remake an OOP program, but as a result it took longer than I thought.
In the process of completing the assignment I better understood the ideas of the OOP 
and how to use the ES6 tools to implement the classes.

## Memory Pair Game

It was a wonderful experience, I am happy to create the first project that looks like a real one!
This task helped to unite my knowledge and reveal weaknesses in them, mainly it concerns working with the DOM.
